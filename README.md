# Scanlings

Camera-driven creature creator + competitive auto-battler.

**Locked stack:** Godot **4.2 LTS** (Android client) + TypeScript (backend on Render).

## What it is
Scan real-world objects to generate cute/cool collectible creatures. Creatures are **archetype-first** (readability) and battle via a **turn-based server-simulated auto-battler**. Fusion uses a second scan to evolve a creature and can unlock a passive (Star Power/Gadget).
